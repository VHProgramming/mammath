Mammath is the python library with all the functions you need to do complicated mathematics, anywhere from 2D and 3D graphing calculators to linear algebra and calculus. We even have a constant for practically anything

It is built upon several other modules including sys, tkinter, string, time, math, cmath, fractions, mpmath, keyboard, numpy, sympy, tabulate, re, matplotlib, and modules within them. 

All categories: <br>
Shunting Yard Algorithm <br>
Math Teachers <br>
Operations (logarithms, factorials, sums, hcf, lcm, etc.) <br>
Prime Numbers <br>
Number / Sequence Checks <br>
Fibonacci <br>
Divisibility checks + learn tricks (beta) <br>
Fractions <br>
Geometry <br>
Sequences <br>
Formulas <br>
Base conversions <br>
Graphing <br>
Algebra <br>
Linear Algebra <br>
Calculus <br>
Complex (complex ln, operations with complex numbers) <br>
Physics (beta) <br>
Miscellaneous (Equation parser, special numbers, tables, times tables) <br>
<br>

We hope Mammath is a useful and reliable asset. Install via <code>pip install mammath</code>
