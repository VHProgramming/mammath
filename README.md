<br>
Mammath is the python library with all the functions you need to do complicated mathematics, anywhere from 2D and 3D graphing calculators to linear algebra and calculus. We even have a constant for practically anything

Release notes for 0.1.9:
Bugs with the graphers all fixed. 
Physics section new and expanding
SUVAT equations

It is built upon several other modules including sys, tkinter, string, time, math, cmath, fractions, mpmath, keyboard, numpy, sympy, tabulate, re, matplotlib, and modules within them.
